# Coding with chatGPT --- Learning Python
[ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ä¸­æ–‡](README_CN.md)

All the code in the repository comes from chatGPT, and I just wanted to learn Python and other languages through chatGPT, that's all.
## py-ytd
py-ytd is the first program I wrote with chatGPT, which is a Python script to download YouTube videos.

### Which implemented:

- A friendly download tool for those new to Python as a tool-language. 
- Download multiple YouTube videos in bulk. 
- Download YouTube videos with age restrictions. 

### Planned features:
- [ ] Display progress bar during download.
